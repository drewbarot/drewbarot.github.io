<h4>Project</h4>
<p>Visit my <a href="https://github.com/drewbarot">Github</a>. These are some projects I have worked on:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/drewbarot/Public-Tutorials">Machine Learning for Stock Price Prediction</a></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Predicting whether the price of a security will be above or below todays value. Uses Machine Learning models such as Neural Networks, Boosted Trees, and SVMs. Presented to over 500 students in total.</li>
		</ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/charlielin99/ourBlock">ourBlock</a></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Community safety app revolutionizing crime reporting via community empowerment & real-time data sharing. Uses AWS Lambda serverless backend, Deep Learning/NLP classifiers, & ethereum distributed storages. Won Top 10 Worlwide at Tech Crunch Disrupt</li>
		</ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/charlielin99/Pinpointr">PinPointr</a></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Real-time location tracking through audio-engineering with built-in data analytics. Used triangulation, multiplexing, kalman filtering, pulse-code modulation, fast fourier transforms and a simple neural network to pinpoint a person's location with ultrasonic frequency emissions through smart phones. Champion at Hack the North - Canada's largest Hackathon.</li>
		</ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/drewbarot/steganofy">Steganofy</a></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Simple project allowing users to create accounts and custom keys to embed their identity in their photos to prevent piracy. Uses steganography to embed a 256-bit key at a pixel-level in Python, and a MEAN stack to handle user and server requests.</li>
		</ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/drewbarot/drewbarot.github.io">My Personal Site</a></li>
	<ul>
		<li>I am still working on this site; stay tuned for updates!</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Experience</h4>
<p>I have experience in machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, algorithmic trading, web & app development, and optimization.</p>
<p>I am currently working as a Machine Learning researcher in the Department of Astrophysics at Western University, where I have developed Bayesian Neural Networks and other statistical methods to discover elements and compounds in interstellar gas clouds.</p>
